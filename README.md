# mRNA Molecular Weight Calculator

A lightweight browser-based **mRNA molecular weight calculator**  
for synthetic RNA design and analysis. Ideal for researchers in  
**RNA therapeutics**, **molecular biology** and **synthetic biology**.
This web-based tool allows you to calculate key properties of messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences.  
It supports custom RNA sequences with optional 5'-Cap structures (e.g., CleanCap®), Ψ (N1-Methylpseudouridine) substitutions, and provides:

- Molecular formula and exact mass (free acid / sodium salt forms)
- Charge estimation
- Nucleotide composition
- Export functionality

⚙️ Built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no backend required.
