# mRNA Molecular Weight Calculator

This web-based tool allows you to calculate key properties of messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences.  
It supports custom sequences, optional Cap structures (e.g., CleanCap®), Ψ (N1-Methylpseudouridine) substitutions, and provides:

- Molecular formula and exact mass (free acid / sodium salt forms)
- Charge estimation
- Nucleotide composition
- Export functionality

⚙️ Built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no backend required.
